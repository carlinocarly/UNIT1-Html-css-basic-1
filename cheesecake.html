            Cook in the preheated oven at 180 ° C for 6-7 minutes; then let it cool. Prepare the filling. Beat the ricotta with an electric whisk until it becomes a soft cream. Mix the vanilla and lemon zest and add a little at a time, sugar,
            flour and a pinch of salt.
            Finally incorporate the eggs, one at a time, stirring after each addition.
            Spread the cream obtained on the biscuit base and pass the preparation in a preheated oven at 200 ° C for 7-8 minutes. Lower the temperature to 120 ° C and continue cooking for 1 hour.
            Let the cake cool in the oven, then transfer it to the refrigerator for about 1 hour.
